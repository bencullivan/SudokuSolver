# Sudoku Solver

A Java Sudoku application that uses recursive backtracking to solve a Sudoku. Includes a GUI that can be used to do a 
Sudoku and also includes a visual demonstration of the recursive backtracking algorithm in action. 

### Running Sudoku Solver

In order to run Sudoku Solver download the source code and open it in an IDE of your choice (I recommend 
[Intellij](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/)). If you want to run it strictly for the purpose of testing the algorithm and do
not want to use the GUI, run src/SudokuSolver. If you want to use the GUI, run src/SudokuGame.
